## Architecture Overview

Orchestra Platform consists of four main components:

1. **Orchestra Operator** - Kubernetes operator managing workshop lifecycle
2. **Orchestra API** - REST API for workshop operations
3. **Orchestra Frontend** - Web application for users
4. **Orchestra Docs** - Comprehensive documentation (this site)

Each workshop gets its own unique subdomain and runs in complete isolation from other workshops.
